# PermissionServer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Perustaja/PermissionServer.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/Perustaja/PermissionServer)
PermissionServer is a library that provides authorization attributes exactly like vanilla ASP.NET, but with support for remote authorization and finely-grained permissions to avoid storing authorization information in a JWT.

Check out the [demo](https://github.com/Perustaja/PermissionServerDemo) to see PermissionServer in action.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/Perustaja/PermissionServer/wiki) for a quick start and full documentation.

If you feel anything is lacking or there are features you'd need before adoption, feel free to open an issue after combing the [roadmap](https://github.com/Perustaja/PermissionServer/wiki/Roadmap).
